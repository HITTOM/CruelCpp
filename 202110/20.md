Back to Basics: Class Layout - Stephen Dewhurst - CppCon 2020

only non-static data declarations add the size of class object
non-virtual functions donot affect class size
an empty class must occupy some space
sizeof(EmptyClass) = 1
no\_unique\_address allow an empty non-static member to share space with another member of different type
class hash\_map {
  [[no\_unique\_address]] Hash hasher;
  [[no\_unique\_address]] Pred pred;
  [[no\_unique\_address]] Allocator alloc;
  Bucket \*buckets;
};

class Derived : public Empty, public NonEmpty1 {

};

cpp guarantees first non-static data member is always at offset 0, so it's reasonable to reinterpret\_cast between class and it's first non-static member.

offsetof(class, member) // #include <cstddef>

bp->f1() translated to (\*(bp->vptr)[0])

avoid virtual base classes
